# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview of the Project
In this challenge, the aim is to create a web application that scrapes data about Mars from various websites. These are;
    - https://redplanetscience.com
    - https://spaceimages-mars.com
    - https://galaxyfacts-mars.com
    - https://marshemispheres.com/
## Tools for Scraping
    1. Use Splinter to automate a web browser.
    2. Use BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the data.
    3. Use MongoDB to hold the data that has been gathered.
    4. Use Flask Application to display the created HTML file.
    5. Use Bootstraps templates to structure your HTML file.
## Summary
BeautifulSoup and Splinter used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and titles of those images. Further, those scraped data are stored on the Mongo database. Finally, the data with a scrape button displays the data and the design of the HTML interface.
